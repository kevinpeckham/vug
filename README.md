# Vug
Early days of construction and exploration.  Nothing to see here yet.

## Goals
	* stripped down version of Pug
	* that supports Tailwindclasses and Svelte syntax natively
  * supports custom element names and retains their case e.g. CustomElement
  * does not have its own iteration or conditionals, instead assumes you will use your JS framework's
  * designed principally to be used with SvelteKit
